[Inroduction]
This plugin implements .ogf, .dm, .object, .omf, .skl, .skls import and
.object and .skl export.

The plugin is designed to work as a partial replacement for official
GSC plugins and is compatible with auxiliary scripts, .mb/.ma files and
official export plugin (xrayMaya_export.mll)


[Installation]
Copy xrayMayaTools.mll into $MAYA_LOCATION\bin\plug-ins,
AEXRayMtlTemplate.mel into $MAYA_LOCATION\scripts\AETemplates,
xray_path.ltx -- into $MAYA_LOCATION\bin (and update $sdk_root$).
Remove xrayMaya_material.mll to avoid conflict.
Disable auto-loading of xrayMaya_export.mll and load it only when
it is actually required. That is necessary to work-around the FPU
precision bug in xrCore.dll.


[Usage]
To import external animations (.skl/.skls/.omf), create and select Maya
character object.

Notes:
 - big files such as stalker_animation.omf require more than 2GB RAM.
